Hi, this project uses a SQL server database. Once the repository is pulled to your local environment, please update the connection string in the appsettings.json file to connect to your local SQL Server instance. Then in the package manager console, run the command 'add-migration initial'. Once that succeeds run the 'update-database' command which should create the necessary database in your local SQL server instance.
